# shack

shack is a solution to help roommates live harmoniously together. Create a roommate agreement for your household and easily access the agreement details through your dashboard instead of looking up various PDFs and emails. Users also have the option to create household-wide notes, for those times when a post-it on the fridge isnâ€™t enough.

**Tech stack**

- **Front End**: React + TypeScript, Chakra UI for component library
- **Back End**: PostgreSQL, API only Ruby on Rails
